# Akkadian-to-English Translation and Reasoning Model

## Overview
This repository hosts the development of a groundbreaking language model designed to translate Akkadian texts into English while reasoning about the language's context and nuances. By combining linguistic expertise, reasoning capabilities, and contextual adaptability, this model aims to push the boundaries of ancient language processing.

The project employs an innovative pretraining framework that integrates:
- **Monolingual Akkadian transcriptions** to build foundational linguistic understanding.
- **Synthetic reasoning datasets** derived from parallel Akkadian-English corpora.
- **Chain-of-thought reasoning tasks** for general cognitive improvement.
- **Contextual analysis datasets** to interpret translations in varying historical and cultural contexts.
- **Fine-tuning-style pretraining data** to enhance logical connections early in training.
- **Instruction fine-tuning** to ensure structured and user-friendly responses.

## Checkpoints
Updated checkpoints will be released periodically throughout the duration of the training process. These will provide:
- Insights into the model's progress and performance on translation and reasoning tasks.
- Opportunities for the community to experiment with intermediate versions of the model.

Stay tuned for updates as we continue refining the model and advancing its capabilities.
