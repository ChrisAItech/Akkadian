# Akkadian-to-English Translation and Reasoning Model

## Overview
This repository hosts the development of a groundbreaking language model designed to translate Akkadian texts into English while reasoning about the language's context and nuances. By combining linguistic expertise, reasoning capabilities, and contextual adaptability, this model aims to push the boundaries of ancient language processing.

The project employs an innovative pretraining framework that integrates:
- **Monolingual Akkadian transcriptions** to build foundational linguistic understanding.
- **Synthetic reasoning datasets** derived from parallel Akkadian-English corpora.
- **Chain-of-thought reasoning tasks** for general cognitive improvement.
- **Contextual analysis datasets** to interpret translations in varying historical and cultural contexts.
- **Fine-tuning-style pretraining data** to enhance logical connections early in training.
- **Instruction fine-tuning** to ensure structured and user-friendly responses.

## Expected Outcome Objectives
The model is expected to:
- **Exhibit a proficient understanding of Akkadian**: Demonstrate strong comprehension of the available corpus of Akkadian texts, including the ability to parse and translate complex sentence structures.
- **Reason about linguistic ambiguities**: Provide insightful reasoning on the meanings of words and phrases, particularly in cases where context or historical nuance influences interpretation.
- **Test domain-specific reasoning**: Act as a benchmark for general reasoning capabilities in a specialized domain, leveraging a training dataset consisting solely of language tokens (Akkadian and English) and reasoning tokens (English).

By achieving these objectives, the model will not only advance translation and interpretation of ancient texts but also contribute to broader research in language reasoning models.

## Checkpoints
Updated checkpoints will be released periodically throughout the duration of the training process. These will provide:
- Insights into the model's progress and performance on translation and reasoning tasks.
- Opportunities for the community to experiment with intermediate versions of the model.

Stay tuned for updates as we continue refining the model and advancing its capabilities.
